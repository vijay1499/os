import os

# Open the file in read-only mode
file_path = "example.txt"
file_descriptor = os.open(file_path, os.O_RDONLY)

# Seek to the 10th character
os.lseek(file_descriptor, 9, os.SEEK_SET)

# Read the next 11 characters (10th to 20th)
data = os.read(file_descriptor, 11)

# Close the file descriptor
os.close(file_descriptor)

# Print the data read from the file
