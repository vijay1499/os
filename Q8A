WAP using system calls which will read from 10th character to 15th character from a file opened in read only mode


#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main()
{
    int fd = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);

    if (fd < 0) {
        perror("Failed to open file");
        exit(1);
    }

    char buffer[7];

    if (lseek(fd, 9, SEEK_SET) < 0) {
        perror("Failed to seek to position");
        close(fd);
        exit(1);
    }

    ssize_t bytes_read = read(fd, buffer, 6);

    if (bytes_read < 0) {
        perror("Failed to read file");
        close(fd);
        exit(1);
    }

    buffer[6] = '\0';

    printf("Data from 10th to 15th character: %s\n", buffer);

    close(fd);

    return 0;
}
