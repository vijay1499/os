 Write a program using system calls to find and print the largest file name(file Size wise) among 3 existing files.
 
 
 import os

# Define the file names
file_names = ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", "file3.txt"]

# Initialize the max file size and max file name
max_file_size = 0
max_file_name = ""

# Loop through the file names
for file_name in file_names:
    # Get the file size using os.path.getsize
    file_size = os.path.getsize(file_name)
    
    # If the current file size is larger than the current max file size, update the max file size and name
    if file_size > max_file_size:
        max_file_size = file_size
        max_file_name = file_name

# Print the max file name and size
print(f"The largest file is {max_file_name} with size {max_file_size} bytes.")
