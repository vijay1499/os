 Write a program in shell programming to print grade wise result of a student
 
 
 #!/bin/bash

# Take input of the student's marks in 5 subjects
echo "Enter the marks of the student in 5 subjects (out of 100):"
read -p "Subject 1: " s1
read -p "Subject 2: " s2
read -p "Subject 3: " s3
read -p "Subject 4: " s4
read -p "Subject 5: " s5

# Calculate the total marks and percentage
total_marks=$((s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 + s5))
percentage=$((total_marks / 5))

# Print out the grade-wise result based on the percentage
if ((percentage >= 90)); then
    echo "Grade: A"
    echo "Result: Pass"
elif ((percentage >= 80)); then
    echo "Grade: B"
    echo "Result: Pass"
elif ((percentage >= 70)); then
    echo "Grade: C"
    echo "Result: Pass"
elif ((percentage >= 60)); then
    echo "Grade: D"
    echo "Result: Pass"
elif ((percentage >= 40)); then
    echo "Grade: E"
    echo "Result: Pass"

    echo "Grade: F"
    echo "Result: Fail"
