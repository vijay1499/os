wap a program using system calls to copy the contents of a file and create four files each containing 1/4 contents of the file.

import os

# Open the input file and read its contents
with open("input_file.txt", "r") as input_file:
    contents = input_file.read()

# Calculate the size of each chunk
file_size = len(contents)
chunk_size = file_size // 4

# Create four output files and write the appropriate chunks to each file
for i in range(4):
    # Determine the start and end indices of the chunk
    start_index = i * chunk_size
    end_index = start_index + chunk_size
    
    # Create the output file name with the format "output_i.txt"
    output_file_name = f"output_{i}.txt"
    
    # Open the output file and write the chunk of data to it
    with open(output_file_name, "w") as output_file:
        output_file.write(contents[start_index:end_index])
        
    # Print a message indicating which chunk was written to which file
    print(f"Wrote chunk {i+1} to file {output_file_name}")
