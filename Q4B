 Write a program using systems for operations on processes to create a hierarchy of processes P1 ? P2 ? P3? P4. Also, print the id and parent id for each process.
 
 import os

# Create the first process P1
pid_p1 = os.getpid()
print(f"Process P1 created with PID {pid_p1} and PPID {os.getppid()}")

# Create the second process P2
pid_p2 = os.fork()
if pid_p2 == 0:
    # This is the child process (P2)
    print(f"Process P2 created with PID {os.getpid()} and PPID {pid_p1}")
    
    # Create the third process P3
    pid_p3 = os.fork()
    if pid_p3 == 0:
        # This is the child process (P3)
        print(f"Process P3 created with PID {os.getpid()} and PPID {os.getppid()}")
        
        # Create the fourth process P4
        pid_p4 = os.fork()
        if pid_p4 == 0:
            # This is the child process (P4)
            print(f"Process P4 created with PID {os.getpid()} and PPID {os.getppid()}")
        else:
            # This is the parent process (P3)
            os.waitpid(pid_p4, 0)
    else:
        # This is the parent process (P2)
        os.waitpid(pid_p3, 0)
else:
    # This is the parent process (P1)
    os.waitpid(pid_p2, 0)
