 Write a program using file manipulation system calls to find and print the largest file name (file Size wise) among 3 existing files. 

import os

# List of 3 file names to check
file_names = ['file1.txt', 'file2.txt', 'file3.txt']

# Initialize max_size and max_file to 0 and empty string respectively
max_size = 0
max_file = ''

# Loop through each file name and get its size
for file_name in file_names:
    # Use os.path.getsize to get the size of the file
    size = os.path.getsize(file_name)
    
    # If the current file size is greater than the current max_size
    if size > max_size:
        # Update max_size and max_file to the current file size and file name
        max_size = size
        max_file = file_name

# Print the largest file name and its size
print(f"The largest file is {max_file} with a size of {max_size} bytes.")
