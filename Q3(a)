//Here's a shell script program that creates a directory, generates 100 text files, and deletes files starting with "Vijay":


#!/bin/bash

# Prompt user for directory name
read -p "Enter directory name: " dirname

# Create directory
mkdir $dirname

# Generate 100 text files
for ((i=1; i<=100; i++))
do
  touch $dirname/textfile$i.txt
done

# Delete files starting with "Vijay"
rm $dirname/Vijay*
