WAP to create two threads. One will print the numbers from 50 to 1 and the other thread will find whether a number entered by the user is prime or not. 


import threading

# Define a function to print the numbers from 50 to 1
def print_numbers():
    for i in range(50, 0, -1):
        print(i)

# Define a function to check whether a number is prime or not
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Get input from the user
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Create two threads
t1 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=is_prime, args=(num,))

# Start the threads
t1.start()
t2.start()

# Wait for both threads to finish
t1.join()
t2.join()

# Print the result of the is_prime function
if t2.result:
    print(f"{num} is a prime number.")
else:
    print(f"{num} is not a prime number.")
